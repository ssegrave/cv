    <h1>Dear Friends</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Dear friends, reproach me not for what I do,  
        Nor counsel me, nor pity me; nor say  
        That I am wearing half my life away  
        For bubble-work that only fools pursue.  
        And if my bubbles be too small for you,
        Blow bigger then your own: the games we play  
        To fill the frittered minutes of a day,  
        Good glasses are to read the spirit through.  
          
        And whoso reads may get him some shrewd skill;  
        And some unprofitable scorn resign,
        To praise the very thing that he deplores;  
        So, friends (dear friends), remember, if you will,  
        The shame I win for singing is all mine,  
        The gold I miss for dreaming is all yours. </p>
